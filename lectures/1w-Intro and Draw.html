## what is programming?

- Needs human beings to provide instructions.
- Write algorithms.
- Need specificity - syntax; condition associated with logic
- Pseudo-code: get use to doing, plan out the logic in your own language
- Philosophy of Incremental development/modular system:
- Put everything into one set of code all at once is kind of impossible.
- Need lots of little pieces-write mini programs one at a time.
- Fit the pieces together!

## what is an algorithm?

instructions for achieving a task

the idea is like making muffins
1. Whisk dry ingredients
2. In another bowl, mix wet ingredients
3. Pour wet on top of dry and fold together
4. Scoop into muffin tins
5. Bake at 400 F
6. Remove from oven

## what is syntax?

The grammatical rules and structural patterns governing the
ordered use of appropriate words and symbols for issuing
commands, writing code, etc., in a particular software application
or programming language.
In Processing, write a tiff file to a folder called frames.

	saveFrame(“frames/####.tif”);
	</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
## what is pseudo-code?

No exact standard.

Idea: use the given structure of a programming language to write the logic in English.

In Processing, write a tiff file to a folder called frames:

1. `saveFrame(“frames/####.tif”);`
2. saveFrame(to a folder called frames, with the name of the file of 4 digit sequence.tif);
3. save the frame as a 4 digit sequence.tif to the frames folder.

the more syntax you can remember, the better!

## what are some programming languages?

HIGH LEVEL (more English like)

Lingo (Director)

Processing (simple environment)

openFrameworks, Cinder

actionscript

ruby

javascript

python

Max/MSP/Jitter (DataFlow environments - box and flow chart based - maybe ore intuitive)

Programming language - 

 Java (it does everything, and are extendable through libraries)

 C/C++/Object C (apple)

 Pascal 

Assembly language: usually uses 4-bit combination (2^4)=16 combinations



Machine language: 0/1

1. talk to screen

2. screen has address

3. specify pixel location

4. each is 0/1

5. specify which one to turn on


LOW LEVEL (execute very fast)

compiler: translate high level codes to low level language

## open source

software is free!
source code is openly available
Processing is created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry under
John Maeda’s MIT Media Lab
download: processing.org
It’s a non-profit foundation.
15th anniversary! Hooray and thank you!

## processing

Launch Processing!
command+r to run a sketch
println("hello world”);
Save sketch - note the folder structure!
Transport by folder, not file!
== for folks coming from Processing 2.
shift+command+r to presentation mode
command+t to tidy up!
shift+command+t to tweak
fullScreen(); replaces size(); ==> new in P3
fullScreen(SPAN); ==> span across multiple screens!
pixelDensity(2); ==> finer smoother lines for retina displays :)
also see pixelHeight and pixelWidth, etc in Reference.
option to export to application for self-running (executable),Android (apps) or JavaScript (web)

`size();`

should always have hard numbers, not variables.

good ==> `size (640, 320);`
not good ==> `size (float, float);`

`size();` should always be the first line of code.

## draw

draw a line:

write in pseudo code first: two points define a line, and use a coordinate system to define these points.

Processing syntax: `line(100,50,600,250);`
So, the format is:  `functionName (_,_,_,_);`
functionName followed by parenthesis, followed by arguments (values separated by commas), ending with a parenthesis, and ending with a semicolon.  

Functions:

rect
ellipse
line
point

Check out: sketch_1_draw.pde

Look up syntax: processing.org, then click on Reference. Command+f.

In class exercise:

1. Use graph paper to sketch out.
2. Then try to make a pseudo code.
3. Then try to code it in Processing.
4. Don’t go wild on me!

## colors

Additive color mixing system: HSB, RGB, hexadecimal
 
Range - 0-255 (black to white)
Think Illustrator vector shape and lines:
stroke and fill are key words that set colors in Processing.
`fill(255, 255, 255);` is the same as `fill (255);`

`fill(grayScale,transparency);`

`fill(R,G,B, alpha)`

alpha=0 is completely transparent

alpha=255 is completely opaque

guess, what is background(135);

## order of operation

the program is drawn in the order it is written

default: what appears first in the code is the lowest layer

	rect(15,15,50,50);
	ellipse(60,60,55,55);

	ellipse(60,60,55,55);
	rect(15,15,50,50);

## white space

spacing does not matter

this:

	size
	(    300,
				   300   )
	;

is the same as:

	size(300,300);
	</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
## readability of code

group things together that belong.

put paragraph break to separate them.

	size(600,400);
	background(135);

	stroke(255, 0, 0);
	fill(100);
	rect(100, 100, 200, 20);

Your future self will thank the present self, if you build a habit to comment.

## the flow of program

most sketches use `setup` and `draw` functions

each is a block of code, indicated with curly brackets

	void setup() {
		//code here
	}
	void draw() {
		//code here
	}
	</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
## setup is a block of code

setup (stuff that happens once, only once)

It’s like File > New in Photoshop, where we want to setup the size of our
canvas and the background color.

	void setup() {
		size(300,300);
		background(255);
	}

	</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
## draw is a block of code

stuff that’s going to happen over and over again

	void draw() {
		background(0);
		fill(255,0,0);
		rect (100,100,200,200);
	}

	</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
## pre-defined functions

Both of these words, `setup` and `draw`, are functions that have been pre-defined by Processing as what to do **once** and what to do **over and over again**.

We are further defining these two functions within what we specify inside the curly
brackets.

	void draw() {
		background(0);
		fill(255,0,0);
		rect (100,100,200,200);
	}
	</script>
</section>

## case sensitive

this:

	size(300,300);

##drawing attributes

	smooth(); // adds anti-aliasing
	noSmooth(); // turns of anti-aliasing
	ellipseMode();
	ellipseMode(CORNER); // center is default
	rectMode();
	rectMode(CORNER); // corner is default
	strokeWeight(x); // x is amount in px

## specifying color syntax

	fill(rgb)
	fill(rgb, alpha)
	fill(gray)
	fill(gray, alpha)
	fill(v1, v2, v3)
	fill(v1, v2, v3, alpha)

Parameters
rgb

int: color variable or hex value

alpha

float: opacity of the fill

gray float: number specifying value between white and black
v1

float: red or hue value (depending on current color mode)

v2

float: green or saturation value (depending on current color mode)

v3

float: blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)

## color attributes

	stroke(); // stroke color
	noStroke(); // turns off stroke
	fill(); // fill color
	noFill(); // turns off fill
	background(); // background color
	colorMode(); // accepts RGB or HSB

once an attribute is set, it remains active until set again
