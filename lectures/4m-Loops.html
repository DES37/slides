conditions
Make sure to format your code!

eat tuna;

if (Tuesday) {
eat tuna;
} else if (Thursday) {
eat turkey;
}

if (Tuesday) {
eat tuna;
} else {
eat tofu;
}

if (Tuesday) {
eat tuna;
} else if (Thursday) {

conditions
What’s wrong with this?
if (Tuesday) {
eat tuna;
} else {
eat tofu;
} else if (Thursday) {
eat turkey;
}

conditions
What’s wrong with this?
if (Tuesday) {
eat tuna;
} else {
eat tofu;
} else if (Thursday) {
eat turkey;
}

logic error: Thursday is a part of the else statement, then do
I eat tofu or turkey? According to order of operation, else if
is ignored.
syntax error: else has to come at the end, if Thursday is an
exception.

Loops

Loops are like the industrial revolution!
Repetitive tasks are done by the machine.

two types of loops
while loop
for loop

while loop
The idea of taking a single concept and repeat it many
many times.
A while loop controls a sequence of repetitions. Ok, that’s
beautiful, because it saves so much time!
However, loops MUST have an exist condition, or it will
lock out! STUCK AND NEVER GET OUT!

compare if to while
In an if statement, if the evaluation inside the () is true, execute the
statement ONCE; if the evaluation is false, don’t execute the statement.
if ( boolean expression ){
statement;
}
In a while statement, as long as the evaluation is true, the statement is
executed INFINITE TIMES.
syntax:
while ( boolean expression ){
statement;
}
The code will run, while the condition inside the () is true. Once the
condition is no longer met, it jumps out of the while loop.

//EXAMPLE 2:
How to symmetrically fit x amount of evenly spaced circles on a canvas?
What is the spacing between the circles?
x+=spacing;

//EXAMPLE 2:
Assuming a particular amount of padding on the left and right, the math is as
follows: spacing = (width - 2*padding) / (number of circles - 1)

0

100

width

}
spacing

padding

padding

math is as follows: (width - 2*padding) / (number of circles - 1)
(600-2*100)/(5-1)=100

loop dangers!
Loops MUST have an exist condition, or it will lock out!
STUCK AND NEVER GET OUT!
/*DANGER!! LOOP STUCK, even though all syntax is correct!
x will forever go to the left and never get out of the loop!
Loops must have an exist plan!
*/

while (x<width){
x=x-1;

two loops

check out - sketch_6_1_two_loop_grid.pde - //EXAMPLE 1, 2
//EXAMPLE 1: DRAW VERTICAL LINES.
float x=50;

//EXAMPLE 2: TWO LOOPS - X AND Y. DRAW A GRID.
float x=50;
float y=50;

void setup() {
size(600, 400);
background (0);
}

void setup() {
size(600, 400);
background (0);
}

void draw() {
while (x<width) {
stroke(255);
line (x, 0, x, height);
x=x+50;
}
}

void draw() {
while (x<width) {
stroke(255);
line (x, 0, x, height);
x=x+50;
}
while (y<height) {
stroke(255);
line (0, y, width, y );
y=y+50;
}
}

while loops can draw infinitely!
check out - sketch_6_1_two_loop_grid.pde - //EXAMPLE 3

//EXAMPLE 3: USE LOOPS TO CREATE ANIMATION.
float x=0;
void setup() {
size(600, 400);
}
void draw() {
background (0);
x=0;
while (x<width && x>=0) {
stroke(255);
line (x, 0, x, height);
x+=random(0, 10);
stroke(255, 0, 0); //red line.
line (x, 0, x, height);
x+= random(10, 100);
}
println(x);
}

for loop
When you don’t need it to be infinite and forever. Great for
controlling repetition. Can be identical to the while loop,
except shorter.

for(init; test; update) {
statements;
}

semicolon!

the following blocks of codes are identical.
check out - sketch_6_2_for_loop.pde

code uses the while loop:
int x=0;
while (x<width) {
 line (x, 0, x, height);
 x=x+20;
 }
code uses the for loop:
for (int x=0; x<width; x=x+20) {
 line (x, 0, x, height);
}

Variable Scope AGAIN!
global variable: we declare at the very top.
for example, at the very top of the code, we write:
float x=0;
this means, it’s true for all blocks of codes.
Rule of thumb for Variable Scope: try to make variable as
local in scope as possible.

global variables don’t work well with for loops! as you can imagine
by its very set up, it can get very confused.

Here is a good example:
void setup() {
  size (600, 400);
}
void draw() {
  background (0);
  stroke(255);
  for (int x=0; x<width; x=x+20) { 
    line(x, 0, x, height);
 }
}
 
x here is a local variable; declare it right when you need to use it.
check out - sketch_6_3_Variable_Scope.pde

for loop: how many times to loop?
There is a counting mechanism
embedded in for loop.
The most common variables used for
generic counting:
i, j and k

for loop
(desire 10 iterations) start at 0 and count up to 9
for (int i=0; i<10; i=i+1) //i++

(desire 10 iterations) start at 0 and count up to 100 by 10
for (int i=0; i<100; i=i+10) //i+=10

(desire 20 iterations) start at 100 and count down to 0 by 5
for (int i=100; i>=0; i=i-5) //i-=5

for loop: nested loops
Used in a situation where two or more variables needed to
be evaluated.
DIY graph paper!
two sets of two for loops
check out - graph_paper_10_px.pde

void setup() {
size(1000, 800);
background(255);
}
void draw() {
for (float x=60; x<950; x+=10) {
for (float y=60; y<750; y+=10) {
point(x, y);
}
}
for (float i=150; i<width-50; i+=100) {
fill(255, 0, 0);
noStroke();
for (float j=150; j<height-50; j+=100) {
ellipse(i, j, 1, 1);
}
}
noFill();
stroke(150);
rect(50, 50, 900, 700); // rect box
saveFrame("graph.tif");
}

i'm feeling loopy and iffy!...which one to use?
Use a while loop if you don’t know how many times you want
the loop to execute (or based on an existing variable)
Use a for loop if you know how many times you want to repeat
Statement inside if only gets executed once

loop vs. draw
LOOP INSIDE OF DRAW
inner loop (while or for) produces one frame of an animation.
outer loop (draw):
example:
step 1 - refresh background
step 2 - draw a frame according to what the while loop produces.
——
This is how draw produces animation.

check out - sketch_6_4_loop_vs_draw.pde

void setup () {
size (600, 400);
}
void draw() {
background(0);
stroke(255);
int x=0;
while (x<width) {
line(x, 0, x, height);
x=x+20;
}
}

// everything the loop does all go inside one frame.
// in this case, all these vertical lines will show up at once,
// when the loop is done looping.
// what if i want the lines to show up one by one?
// this type of animation needs to be achieved in draw.

check out - sketch_6_4_loop_vs_draw.pde

//Example 2: draw a vertical line one by one to the right.
int x=50;
void setup() {
size(600, 400);
background (0);
stroke(255);
}
void draw() {
line(x, 0, x, height);
x=x+50;
}
//this one goes by too fast. how to control the speed of animation? See
sketch_6_4_loop_animation.

check out - sketch_6_4_loop_animation.pde
float frX=0; //flexible animation frame width, so that the while loop can meet exit condition.
int aSpeed=1; //control advancing speed
void setup () {
size (600, 400);
}
void draw() {
background(0);
stroke(255);
int x=0; //each time it draws, x needs to go back to 0 and start all over from left,
//where frX continues to get bigger and bigger.
while (x<frX) {
line(x, 0, x, height);
x=x+20; //x can only be 0, 20, 40, 60, etc.
}

}

frX=frX+aSpeed;

/*
step 1 draw a background.
step 2 program goes inside the while loop, and draws a number of lines on a frame,
or it doesn't draw and comes out the loop and continue to increase frX until it hits the next increment of x.
The animations goes like this: frame 1 - one line, frame 2 - two lines, frame 3 - three lines, etc. refresh background in
between. each frame.
